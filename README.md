Comprehensive Power Bi Dashboard 

This read me file provides a comprehensive overview of the project that I have conducted to create and visualize a income statement dashboard from scratch using Power BI

This readme.md file will act as an information file:

The repository contains three files related to the project:

FinancialStatementFY23Q2.csv: This file has the Microsoft financial data from FY2016 to FY2023 Q2, including balance sheets, cash flows, and other sheets. For this project, we only use the yearly income statements sheet.
                              
Income_statement_dashboard.pbix: This file is the main Power BI file that analyzes the income statement data. It involves data cleaning, processing, and 
                                  transformation using Power Query editor, and data visualization using various Power BI visuals, such as clustered column chart,
                                  table, and KPIs.
                                  
Income statement.png: This file is a simple png file that I created with Paint and used as the background for the dashboard.
